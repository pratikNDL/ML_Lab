## Lab Descriptions

### Lab 1: Cost Function
- **Objective**: Implement the cost function for a simple linear regression model.
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Introduction to the cost function.
  - Focus on Mean Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate model performance.
- **Outcome**: Understand how the cost function is used to measure the accuracy of machine learning models.

### Lab 2: Linear Regression
- **Objective**: Build a linear regression model from scratch.
- **Key Concepts**: 
  - Hypothesis function and parameter tuning.
  - Gradient Descent for optimization.
  - Calculation of model parameters using training data.
- **Outcome**: Master the fundamentals of linear regression and model training using gradient descent.

### Lab 3: Logistic Regression & Multiclass Logistic Regression
- **Objective**: Implement logistic regression for binary classification and extend it to multiclass classification.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Part 1**: Binary Logistic Regression.
  - **Part 2**: Multiclass Logistic Regression using the one-vs-all approach.
- **Outcome**: Learn to apply logistic regression for both binary and multiclass classification tasks.

### Lab 4: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Objective**: Implement Support Vector Machines (SVM) for regression and classification tasks.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Part 1**: Support Vector Regression (SVR).
  - **Part 2**: Support Vector Classification (SVC) with linear and non-linear kernels.
- **Outcome**: Gain experience in using SVM for both classification and regression, and explore kernel methods for non-linear tasks.

### Lab 5: Decision Tree
- **Objective**: Implement a decision tree for classification tasks.
- **Key Concepts**:
  - Tree construction and splitting criteria.
  - Tree pruning to avoid overfitting.
  - Model evaluation with different datasets.
- **Outcome**: Develop a strong understanding of decision trees and their application in real-world classification problems.
